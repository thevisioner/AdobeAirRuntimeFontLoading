The fontswf utility is a simple command line tool that converts a single font face from a font file into a SWF file. This SWF file can be used as the source of an embedded font in your applications. Supported font file types are *.ttf, *.otf, *.ttc, and *.dfont.

The fontswf utility is for users of the Mozilla Public License version of the Flex SDK. This version includes only open-source technology. Because the font managers are not open-source, this utility can be used in their place so that you can embed fonts in your applications.

The fontswf utility is in the sdk_root/bin directory of the Flex SDK. For Flash Builder, the fontswf utility is located in the sdks/4.6.0/bin directory. If you do not have the fontswf utility in your bin directory, you must get a more recent version of the SDK.
